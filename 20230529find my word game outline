//1.creat a list named wordList
//2.Print a welcome message
//3.select a random word:
     //3.1 creat a random object named random to generate random numbers
     //3.2 generate a random index within the range of wordList
     //3.3 retrive a random wor
// 4. initialize the number of attempts left to 5
// 5. initialize a boolean variable 'wordGuessed' as false
// 6. creat a 'StringBuilder' named 'guessedword' with an initial value of underscores
// 7. creat a scanner object
// 8. enter a loop continues until the number of attempts left is greater than 0 and the secret word is not guessed:
     //8.1 display the number of attempts and the current state of the guessed word
     //8.2 prompt user to enter a letter
     //8.3 read the first character user input and assign it to the variable 'guess'
     //8.4 initialize a boolean variable ' letterFound' as false
     //8.5 iterate over each character in the secret word using a for loop:
           //8.5.1 if the current character matches the guessed letter, update the corresponding position in 'guessedWord' and set 'LetterFound to ture
           //8.5.2 if letterFind is true print""
           //8.5.3 otherwise print ""
    9.Print the secret word to console
    10. check the value of 'wordGuessed'
        // 10.1 if it's true, print""
        // 10.2 if it's false, print""
